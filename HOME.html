   <section><h2> I noticed how devastated you were some time ago when you wanted Deebo’s pictures saved somewhere on the cloud but couldn’t find a solution. In admiration of Deebo and the love you shared with him, I decided to create a website for you. While it may not capture his essence fully, I’ve put together a collage with all the pictures of Deebo I could find, as well as the ones you have shared. This is my gift to you, a tribute to the memories you shared with Deebo that we all cherish.</section>
   <footer><h2>Thank you for being you. Enjoy your special day! and i hope you like this lol &#128557&#128557 </h2></footer>
